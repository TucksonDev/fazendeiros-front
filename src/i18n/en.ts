        faq1Question: "What is a DAO?",
        faq1Answer:
            "DAO, or Decentralised Autonomous Organisation, is an organisation with a purpose agreed by its members and managed by rules encoded by blockchain-based smart contracts. It is transparent and democratically controlled by its members and allows people from all over the world to work together in a secure and trustworthy way.",
        faq2Question: "How can I be part of Fazendeiros DAO?",
        faq2Answer:
            "To be part of our DAO it is necessary to have our token. Currently Fazendeiros DAO is a private club so to obtain our token it is necessary to fill in <a href='{applicationFormLink}' target='_blank'>our application form</a>, the access will be voted by all members and after the transfer of the token value the token will be sent to the new member. In the future the access will be released to everyone and the token can be mined directly from our site if there is an ongoing round, or in one of the secondary markets (OpenSea, LooksRare, X2Y2, ...).",
        faq3Question: "How to participate in Fazendeiros DAO?",
        faq3Answer:
            "Fazendeiros members can be active members, proposing investments, managing teams and voting on the next steps of the DAO. Or they can also be passive members who just buy the token and participate in voting if they wish to do so.",
        faq4Question: "How does a Fazendeiros DAO member earn returns?",
        faq4Answer:
            "There are two ways to earn returns in the DAO depending on whether the member is active or not.<br />Active members will be able to earn returns depending on the success of their proposals, management and the value they bring to the DAO. For more details on this please read our White paper.<br />Passive members will obtain their returns with the valuation of the Token and with the distribution of dividends that the DAO decides to distribute at any time to the holders of each token.",
        faq5Question: "What is the voting process for DAO proposals?",
        faq5Answer:
            "All members can propose new investments and asset sales. They can also propose new work processes and establish the best way to manage the DAO. Each proposal will be voted on digitally, using Snapshot (a governance platform) and all token owners will be able to vote by connecting their wallet. Once the proposal has been voted on, the result of the vote will be executed.",
        faq6Question: "Will I have more voting power if I have more tokens?",
        faq6Answer:
            "At the moment, yes, but the DAO is looking at what limitations we could apply to improve its security. Among the options we are analysing is to set a ceiling of 10% as a limit on voting power or to give more voting power to those token holders with more seniority in the DAO. These limitations would only apply to voting power, they would not apply to the distribution of profits per token. Members can buy as many tokens as they wish and the financial benefits will not be altered.",
        faq7Question: "What does Fazendeiros DAO invest in?",
        faq7Answer:
            "At the moment the focus of Fazendeiros DAO is to invest in tokenised digital assets such as metaverse lands, skins, game characters and blue-chip collections. However, it is the group of members who decide. We understand that as new members with specialized knowledge join us, we will be able to expand the types of assets to be invested in.",
        faq8Question: "Can I sell my Fazendeiros token?",

These channels are situated on our own website, as well as Discord channels and Twitter, among others.",
        faq10Question: "What is the legal status of Fazendeiros DAO?",
        faq10Answer:
            "Currently, DAOs are not regulated in almost any country, although work is starting to be done on that process. Depending on the activities we carry out, we may or may not need to create our legal personality. Currently, due to our structure and activity, we understand that it is not necessary to formalise our activity in the traditional means. If in the future we need to formalize our activity this need will be presented to the DAO and the type of legal personality and the territory of action will be voted on.",
        faq11Question: "Will current members have any benefit in future Fazendeiros DAO mintings?",
        faq11Answer:
            "Yes, from time to time and after being decided by the DAO members, a new round of tokens will be made available to the market. A percentage of this new amount will be reserved so that token holders can pre-purchase the tokens they wish, within the agreed limits.",
        faq12Question: "Where are the DAO's assets and who manages them?",
        faq12Answer:
            "A management team has been appointed to manage the DAO for a specific period of time and mandate. This team will be in charge of carrying out all the operations voted on by the DAO and will keep the DAO informed of the status of the assets. The DAO has for this purpose different wallets on different Blockchains where the invested assets are located.",
